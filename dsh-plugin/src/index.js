 * loader. The bundled Python service ships next to this package
 * (`scripts/workbench.py` + `assets/workbench.html`), so its absolute path is
 * resolved relative to THIS module (`import.meta.url`) — never hard-coded to a
 * specific machine — and handed to the shared body as `config.script`.

 * Whether this process can really create files in `dir` (mkdir + write + delete).

 * A writable-looking DACL proves nothing: DSH runs the Python service as a
 * sandboxed child whose restricted token may write only the session workspace and
 * a private temp directory it hands the child through TEMP/TMP — never the
 * ambient %TEMP% root the parent sees. Probing by an actual create is the only
 * test that reflects what a child can do, and the probe must fail fast (see
 * `make_temp_file` in workbench.py for why `tempfile.mkstemp` is unusable here).
 *
 * A successful probe leaves the directory behind, so it is marked ignored right
 * away: the runtime root normally sits in the user's own repository, and probing
 * must not be what dirties their `git status` (see `self_ignore` in workbench.py,
 * which does the same for the directory the service settles on).
